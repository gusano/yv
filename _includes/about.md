<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <b>Septentrion</b> is a performance project involving psychoacoustics, dance, singing, clown work and improvisation.<br />
  Developed in 2013 by <a href="http://yvanvolochine.com" target="_blank">Yvan Volochine</a> as research on the subconscious.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Septentrion</b> performances, or actions, can be seen as physical tests as well as multi-sensorial experiences, putting the audience in heavy emotional states, from stress to delight.<br />
  Music and sounds also play an important role in the performances. All musical pieces are written or recorded by Yvan Volochine.
  When needed, self-made controllers, sensors and single-board micro-computers are used.<br />
  Actions can be driven by the location history and culture, but not necesarily. They are the result from an intensive work on improvisation, breathing and energy.<br />
  Actions are designed to be ephemeral and their documentation is rare.

<p>
  Audience discretion is advised.
